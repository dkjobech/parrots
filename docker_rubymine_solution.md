# Solution for Rails Generator Commands in Docker

## Problem Identified
The "Run Anywhere" commands that start with "rails g" are not running in the Docker container because RubyMine is not properly configured to execute these commands in the Docker environment.

## Solution Steps

1. **Configure Docker Integration in RubyMine**
   - Go to **Settings/Preferences** → **Build, Execution, Deployment** → **Docker**
   - Ensure Docker integration is properly configured

2. **Set Up Remote Ruby SDK for Docker**
   - Go to **Settings/Preferences** → **Languages & Frameworks** → **Ruby SDK and Gems**
   - Add a new remote SDK using Docker Compose
   - Select your docker-compose.yml file and the "web" service
   - Set Ruby interpreter path to "/usr/local/bin/ruby" (or correct path in container)
   - Name it "Docker Ruby"

3. **Set Docker Ruby as Project SDK**
   - Go to **File** → **Project Structure**
   - Under "Project SDK", select the Docker Ruby SDK you created

4. **Configure Run Anything for Docker**
   - Press Ctrl+Ctrl (double-tap Control) to open Run Anything dialog
   - Click settings icon in top-right corner
   - Check "Use command-line tools from Docker Compose"
   - Select your docker-compose.yml file and "web" service

After completing these steps, your "rails g" commands will execute properly inside the Docker container when using RubyMine's "Run Anywhere" feature.
